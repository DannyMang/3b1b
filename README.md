generative coding model trained to ONLY generate 3B1B videos using https://github.com/DannyMang/3b1b library!

update: we will use community edition found at https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/ since community version looks more polished

- ALL OF GRANT"S VIDEO CODE CAN BE FOUND : https://github.com/3b1b/videos

# April 28, 2025
- lets try finetuning a model to see how good it performs 

# May 3
- came across https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth, we're gna use this to finetune efficiently:
- relevant resources https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/qwen3-how-to-run-and-fine-tune#fine-tuning-qwen3-with-unsloth
- https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/datasets-guide
- https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/fine-tuning-guide

- current goal build dataset to finetune on 
- we will be using qwen 3, 14b just because alibaba >

overview of plans:
1. Modern Serverless Architecture?
[User Interface] → [API Gateway] → [Authentication Service] → [LLM Service] → [Rendering Service]
                                                           ↓
                           [Database] ← [Payment Processing] → [User Management]
Key Components:

Frontend: React/Next.js application hosted on Vercel or Netlify
API Gateway: AWS API Gateway or Cloudflare Workers
Authentication: Auth0 or Supabase for secure user authentication
LLM Service: Containerized Qwen3 model on AWS ECS/EKS or GCP Cloud Run
Rendering Service: Service that takes generated Manim code and renders videos
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data and generated content
Payment Processing: Stripe for handling subscriptions and one-time purchases

2. Security Measures
Input Validation: Implement strict validation of user inputs to prevent prompt injection attacks
Rate Limiting: Limit API calls per user to prevent abuse
Content Filtering: Filter both input prompts and model outputs for inappropriate content
Output Sanitization: Validate and sanitize generated code before execution
Encryption: Use TLS for data in transit and encryption for data at rest
Authentication: Implement robust OAuth or JWT-based authentication
Monitoring: Set up logging and real-time monitoring to detect unusual patterns
Regular Audits: Conduct security audits of your infrastructure

UX/UI Design for Your Target Audiences
Product will serve two main audiences:
1. Developers
Developers want control, documentation, and efficiency.
Key UX Elements:

Clean, minimalist interface with code view options
Detailed API documentation with examples
Option to customize parameters (temperature, etc.)
Code export functionality with different format options
Git integration for version control of animations

2. Educators/Teachers
Educators want simplicity, visual feedback, and educational value.
Key UX Elements:

Guided wizard interface with templates
Visual preview of animations in real-time where possible
Curriculum integration examples
Ability to save and organize projects by subject/lesson
Collaboration features for team teaching
Export formats compatible with classroom presentation software

Product Revenue Model
I recommend a tiered approach:
1. Free Tier

Limited number of generations per month
Basic animation capabilities
Watermarked videos
Community access

2. Professional Tier ($19.99/month)

Unlimited generations
Advanced animation capabilities
No watermarks
Priority rendering
API access with rate limits
Export in multiple formats

3. Enterprise Tier ($99.99/month or custom pricing)

Everything in Professional
Dedicated API resources
Higher rate limits
Custom integrations
Priority support
Team collaboration features

4. Educational Discount

50% off for verified educators
Special school/district pricing

Technical Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP (2-3 months)

Deploy Qwen3 model with basic prompting
Build simple web UI for text-to-animation generation
Implement basic user authentication
Set up simple payment processing with Stripe
Develop basic animation rendering pipeline

Phase 2: Enhancement (2-3 months)

Improve model fine-tuning with user feedback
Build API for developer access
Add more animation templates and examples
Implement more robust security measures
Develop education-specific features

Phase 3: Scaling (2-3 months)

Optimize infrastructure for cost and performance
Implement advanced analytics
Build collaboration features
Develop integration plugins for common education platforms
Expand marketing and partnership efforts

Technology Stack Recommendations
Frontend

Framework: Next.js with TypeScript
UI Library: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
State Management: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
Animation Preview: Three.js or custom WebGL renderer

Backend

API: Node.js with Express or FastAPI with Python
LLM Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes or serverless options like AWS Lambda
Database: MongoDB for flexibility or PostgreSQL for relational data
Caching: Redis for performance optimization
Video Processing: FFmpeg for video generation

Infrastructure

Cloud Provider: AWS, GCP, or Azure
CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
Monitoring: Datadog or Prometheus + Grafana
Security: AWS WAF, CloudFlare, or Akamai

User Journey Example
For a teacher named Sarah creating a physics animation:

Sarah visits your landing page and sees examples of physics animations
She signs up for a free account using her school email
She's presented with template options and selects "Physics Concepts"
She enters a prompt: "Create an animation showing how a pendulum's period relates to its length"
The system generates Manim code and renders a preview
Sarah can tweak parameters and regenerate if needed
She previews the animation and decides to export it
Since she's on a free tier, she sees an upgrade prompt but also gets a watermarked version
She decides to upgrade to the Educational tier for her classroom
After payment, she can export the animation in HD without watermarks
She receives the animation and code, which she can modify for future lessons

Marketing Strategy

Content Marketing: Create educational blogs about using animations in teaching
Social Media: Showcase impressive animations on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok
Educational Partnerships: Partner with educational platforms and curriculum providers
Developer Relations: Engage with the Manim and Python communities
Email Marketing: Send newsletters with animation tips and updates
SEO: Optimize for keywords related to educational animations and Manim

Conclusion and Next Steps
Your Manim AI product has strong potential across both developer and educational markets. By focusing on security, usability, and value creation, you can build a sustainable business.
Immediate next steps:

Create detailed technical specifications
Build a minimal viable product (MVP)
Gather early user feedback
Iterate on security and UX
Scale gradually based on demand
