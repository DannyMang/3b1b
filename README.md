generative coding model trained to ONLY generate 3B1B videos using https://github.com/DannyMang/3b1b library!

update: we will use community edition found at https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/ since community version looks more polished

- ALL OF GRANT"S VIDEO CODE CAN BE FOUND : https://github.com/3b1b/videos

# April 28, 2025
- lets try finetuning a model to see how good it performs 

# May 3
- came across https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth, we're gna use this to finetune efficiently:
- relevant resources https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/qwen3-how-to-run-and-fine-tune#fine-tuning-qwen3-with-unsloth
- https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/datasets-guide
- https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/fine-tuning-guide

- current goal build dataset to finetune on 
- we will be using qwen 3, 14b just because alibaba >>>>
